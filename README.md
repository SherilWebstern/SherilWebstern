## About me 

#### My name is Sheril and this GitHub is created for self-development, contributons and pursuing my dream _✧career✧_
---

### My plans:

Here I will upload some of my desired self-development tasks/books to track the progress and topics which need to be covered.
Most of the literature will be related to the Reverse Engineering and Learning Languages from C family such as: C, C++, ~~C#~~, Java and Assembler x86.
